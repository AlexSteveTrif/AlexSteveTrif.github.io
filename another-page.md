## Featured Project: Enhancing the Okanagan College Student Investment Fund

As a member of the Okanagan College Student Investment Fund (OCSIF), I was privileged to contribute to a project that sat at the crossroads of financial analysis and data-driven decision-making. My role involved leveraging my background in science and passion for mathematics to enhance the fund's strategic approach to investment.

### Project Overview

The project's objective was to refine the fund's portfolio management by introducing advanced analytical models. My responsibility was to construct and implement a series of quantitative tools designed to predict stock performance, evaluate portfolio risk, and provide comprehensive risk-return assessments.

### Key Contributions

- **Financial Modeling**: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to distill vast amounts of stock market data into principal components, aiding in the identification of underlying factors affecting stock prices and enabling better prediction accuracy.
- **Data Automation**: Developed R scripts to automate the extraction and processing of complex datasets. This initiative drastically improved the efficiency of data handling, allowing for more time to be spent on analysis rather than data preparation.
- **Risk Analysis**: Crafted and integrated a custom Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) model to quantify and communicate the fund's risk exposure. This helped in striking a balance between pursuing optimal returns and maintaining a tolerable risk threshold.

### Impact

The project was pivotal in guiding the fund's investment decisions through turbulent market periods. By providing a clear visualization of potential risks and market-to-market valuations, my work empowered the fund managers with the information necessary to make informed decisions and safeguard the portfolio's health. My contributions were acknowledged as instrumental in optimizing the fund's performance, showcasing my ability to translate analytical concepts into tangible financial strategies.

### Looking Forward

This experience was more than just a project; it was a profound learning journey that solidified my resolve to pursue a career in data analytics within the healthcare sector. The project underscored the importance of data in making strategic decisions, a principle I am excited to apply in healthcare analytics to improve patient outcomes and drive innovation in medical services.
